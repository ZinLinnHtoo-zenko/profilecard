## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I solid my flex usage to align the elements. I also practice to write clean and memorable code when I looked back again. I am more and more aware of mobile first approach is worth as its layout style is simple so simple first and then turn into muliple. I notice my thinking time is less and less than before.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about image responsive layout as this makes me confuse to align different screen sizes. Maybe it's better to use @medi for responsive web design.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://chatgpt.com/) - For asking questions to understand concepts and clean code to write.
- [Resource 2] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is also helpful for my progress because in this website, I can learn concepts with examples.
